# Real Time Sign Language Recognition
Build a real time sign language recognition project using LSTM and GRU models. I have created datast using webcam and then extract features from that dataset with the help of mediapipe and then trained  LSTM and GRU models on that features. In features extraction i have taken face, pose and hands features you can igonore some features also if not required.
